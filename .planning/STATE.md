# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** v15.0 Package Dogfood — COMPLETE — Phase 148 done, all INTG requirements satisfied, milestone shipped

## Current Position

Phase: 148 of 148 (Integrate)
Plan: 2 of 2 complete in phase 148
Status: Phase 148-02 complete — INTG-03 + INTG-04 satisfied; Mesher calls slugify() from registry-installed mesh-slug in a real code path; v15.0 milestone complete
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — 148-02 complete: queries.mpl imports mesh-slug, insert_org uses slugify(name) for auto-slug, meshc build exits 0

Progress: [██████████] 100% (v15.0)

## Performance Metrics

**All-time Totals (through v14.0):**
- Plans completed: 394
- Phases completed: 145
- Milestones shipped: 24 (v1.0-v14.0)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v14.0]: meshpkg publish/install CLI exists and is functional; credentials stored at ~/.mesh/credentials
- [v14.0]: mesh.toml format: [package] name/version/description and [dependencies] sections; mesh.lock lockfile
- [v14.0]: Registry immutable versions (HTTP 409 on duplicate publish); exact versions only (no SemVer ranges)
- [v14.0]: meshc test discovers *.test.mpl files; each compiled+executed independently as a full Mesh program
- [v15.0 Roadmap]: Phase 146 (build library) must complete before Phase 147 (publish) — cannot publish what does not exist
- [v15.0 Roadmap]: Phase 147 (publish) must complete before Phase 148 (integrate) — Mesher install requires live registry entry
- [146-01]: Mesh module export system uses FxHashMap<String, Scheme> keyed by name only; arity overloading across module imports NOT supported — slugify/2 named slugify_with_sep/2
- [146-01]: println() is a Mesh builtin used directly; IO is not a module in the Mesh stdlib
- [146-02]: Case arm bodies must appear on same line as -> arrow (Mesh parser constraint)
- [146-02]: Mutual recursion between top-level functions not supported in Mesh (single-pass typechecker)
- [146-02]: Lambda type annotations: fn(p) -> expr end (no type annotation on args, no do..end block)
- [146-02]: split/filter-empty/join is the idiomatic Mesh pattern for slug normalization
- [Phase 147-01]: Root-level .mpl files added to meshpkg tarball before src/ block; installed packages discovered from .mesh/packages/*/ in meshc build_project()
- [Phase 147-02]: Registry publish requires GitHub-scoped name in mesh.toml ({owner}/{package}); meshpkg login --token stores to ~/.mesh/credentials; 409 on re-publish is acceptable (immutable registry)
- [Phase 147-03]: Scoped packages install to .mesh/packages/{owner}/{name}@{version}/ (two-level layout); discovery.rs Phase 1b must walk two levels deep; default meshpkg registry is api.packages.meshlang.dev
- [Phase 148-01]: mesher/mesh.toml now declares "snowdamiz/mesh-slug" = "1.0.0"; meshpkg install succeeds without --registry flag; credentials from ~/.mesh/credentials used automatically; sha256 checksum in mesh.lock matches e2e consumer verification
- [Phase 148-02]: insert_org uses empty-string sentinel for optional slug param: "" triggers slugify(name) auto-generation; non-empty slug uses as-is; seed migration unaffected (uses raw SQL INSERT); from Slug import slugify is the correct import pattern for installed Mesh packages

### Pending Todos

None.
